# RevatureProjectOneMeetingReports

#### 7/25/2024

Yesterday we merged all our branches to prepare to work with our database. Our biggest hurdle were the merge conflicts, but we were able to successfully solve these.

Today we are creating our property files and attempting to connect our projects with the remote database. After doing this we plan to continue working on our method implementations.
