# RevatureProjectOneMeetingReports

7/25/2024
Yesterday the Team finished up feature structures and aws database setup. There wasn't really any roadblocks, and everything was pushed up to Git.

Today we will be working on implementing jpa and spring framework into the application. 
We divided tasks into features and later today we will merge our branches and see what new implementations need to be made.
