Project Is Just Starting so There isn't anyone talking about Roadblocks, Mostly figuring out how to setup the ERD.

We belive it will take 4 Tables, Jacob and Gilberto will be focusing on Learning Sprint Faster for their planed Trello/implementation goals While Karla and Asaf are focusing on getting the Java Side of the Project Setup.
