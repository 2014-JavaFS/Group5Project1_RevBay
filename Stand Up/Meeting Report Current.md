# RevatureProjectOneMeetingReports

#### 7/30/2024

Yesterday the Team was working on fixing code related to making postman api calls function, and their about me section. Roadblocks were that what we thought our API was asking for wasn't what it actually wanted in some instances and caused issues.

Today We attempted to figure out and fix those API/Repository issues, and finish our about me things with time permiting studying for the test tommorow and doing the SQL competency assignment.
